Three months ago, the first citizen of Holodun was murdered. Found ripped apart, his guts glistening in the morning light. Their name was Grungus Dibblins. It was concluded that wolves had gotten into the town and stormed the open doors of the Laughter House, a comedy restaurant that sits on the edge of town. Chef Wigglies, the owner of the place, was devastated. He had left the doors open to his restaurant. Grungus suffered from severe depression and came to the Laughter House for a little spark in his dull, sad life. Now, he would never laugh again.

No further precautions were taken as nobody actually liked Grungus. And a month later… it happened again. Half of a late night visitor to the Laughter House was found strewn across the stage of the establishment. Her other half was never found. Her name was Dinkling. Though Laughter House’s reputation was forever tarnished, the second murder was eventually chalked up to just a coincidence. Nobody really liked Dinkling either.

A few weeks later the town’s parent teacher association were massacred by an angry student. Their souls, for whatever reason, did not pass on. Many stayed behind and resumed their place within society, to some protest. The culprit of the massacre was assumed to be the Laughter House Murderer, and is currently staying at the county jail, awaiting execution. The town of Holodun was in ruins, but at least there was an end to this reign of terror.

And then, almost a month ago tragedy struck once more. Another murder. Boisterous Barry, the town’s most beloved stage actor, was killed halfway through a set by some sort of vicious beast. Three audience members were also killed but they weren’t very well known. One survived, but is basically catatonic from trauma.

People are whispering nervously about the recent murders. Sheriff Riggins said the lead detective had solved the case and a few important townsfolk have gathered to witness his accusation. Chef sits next to his recently deceased friend and victim of the school massacre, Friday. Chef has always been a shorter, leaner man, but Friday you notice, after not having seen your friend in quite awhile, that he looks a little stockier today. You remember that he was drafted to serve on the town’s night watch a few months ago and he must’ve been beefing up! Chef, Friday is looking… pretty grisly. Since the massacre you haven’t been able to visit much, but up close you seem him as he truly is. You can see how the tips of his fingers are beginning to fade away. Now and then you notice what looks like puncture wounds on his chest.

Moments later the town’s leader, Detective Bunko, drags a pale, translucent figure into the room.

This is Alamrose “Fuckmaster,” a soulbound specter accused of murdering and fucking Farmer Boyle’s livestock. He lies to Sheriff Cassidy, somewhat convincing her of his innocence. He is asked to clear his name of guilt from the Laughter House Murders first, along with Chef and one volunteer, who happens to be Friday.

The three check the park and run into Coach Joshua of the little league kickgoalball team. He says he saw a huge beast running around Chef’s house a few weeks back, and also says Paula is stirring up drama for Friday’s kid Mardi on the team. They check with PTA parents Cheryl and Jerry, who say the first person they’d check is the reclusive mini-golf owner who disappeared a few months back.

Al gets tired and questions Chef about who might want to hurt his business. The only person that comes to mind is Chuck Mance, the short one-eyed and sickly owner of the Chuckle Mansion across the street. Chuck refuses to give evidence that would clear Chef’s name, so Chuck challenges him to a Chuckle Off. Chuck starts with a great lead but Chef begins to laugh harder and louder than him, intimidating and distracting Chuck so that Friday and Al can sneak into the back of the Chuckle Mansion and search.

Friday picks up an empty magical knock-knock joke book. In the basement they find a dead pig that smells vaguely of semen to Al. In the upper floor Al finds a crystal ball that has been recording the Laughter House for over a month. Within it is footage showing a large canine beast exiting the Laughter House, proving the murders were done by some feral creature.

As Chuck begins to lose the contest, he throws a fork at Chef to distract him. Sure enough, Chuck gets the lead for one big laugh, but Chef pulls the fork out and destroys him with a laugh just hearty enough to finish off Chuck. Chuck slides over the wager, nine gold, and resigns himself upstairs. Al jumps out the window and Friday hides in a curtain. Just as Chuck is about to find him, Al ding-dong-ditches the front of the establishment, allowing Friday enough time to escape.

They show the footage to Sheriff Cassidy, who decides to clear Chef and Al’s name. They also accuse Chuck of being a zoophilic necrophile. Farmer Boyle is not yet satisfied. He will only not press charges if Al can hunt down the beast that’s been feeding on his animals. Cassidy guilt trips Chef and Friday into voluntarily joining his hunt.

Friday tucks Mardi into bed and tells him to look after his siblings.
