Alamrose sneaks down the ladder and meets a family of Manflowers. He checks around what appears to be an underground office for Professor Fiore. Above, Friday and Chef get curious and follow him, immediately blowing the heist. Chef gets down the ladder just as Friday’s noisy chainmail alerts the guards. One runs after Chef and falls onto him on the ladder, knocking Chef onto the ground from midway down the ladder and splatting against the ground himself. The guard is dead, Chef barely alive. Friday tries to impersonate the guard as he starts climbing down, the guard shooting at him but phasing through Friday. Chef eats a bear fruit to heal his broken legs, and Alamrose shoots a warning shot up at the guard. Friday disguises himself magically as the guard who died, but by the time he’s ready to reveal himself, the guard upstairs has run away.
